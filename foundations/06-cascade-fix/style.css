/* As for the 'div' element in index.html that has both 'text' and 'child' class attributes, 
both of the below declarations would apply to it and thus conflict. In each of the below blocks, there are class 
selectors and type selectors; class selectors have the highER priority, but there is the same number of class selectors in each 
declaration block, so we can't consider class selectors in resolving the conflict. Move onto the type 
selectors, and you see that there is 1 type selector in the second declaration block, but 0 in the first. 
Therefore, the second declaration block wins.*/
